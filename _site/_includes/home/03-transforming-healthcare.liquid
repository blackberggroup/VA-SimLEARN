          Simulation-based training for safer, high-quality care for Veterans
        </h2>
        <p class="usa-body">
          Simulation Learning, Evaluation, Assessment, and Research Network
          (SimLEARN) is pioneering health care transformation through
          simulation-based training across the largest integrated health system
          in the U.S. Our mission is to shape VA into a High Reliability
          Organization (HRO) where patient safety is a top priority, and
          medical errors are minimized.
        </p>
        <p class="usa-body">
          SimLEARN provides cutting-edge simulation curricula allowing health
          care professionals to practice critical diagnostic, procedural, and
          communication skills by recreating real-world clinical scenarios in a
          safe, controlled environment.
        </p>
        <p class="usa-body">
          Through immersive experiences such as nurses running code team
          simulations and surgeons rehearsing in virtual reality, SimLEARN
          equips providers with decision-making abilities and muscle memory to
          deliver higher-quality care without putting patients at risk.
          SimLEARN is advancing innovative simulation methodologies to improve
          clinical performance, reduce errors, and ensure the best possible
          outcomes for Veterans.
